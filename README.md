# waitless

A application that will let users find restaurants around their current location (or in a specific city/state) and
let them add their names to the waitlist. The application uses Geolocation, Yelp-Fusion api, and a database/api that I have created myself. 

## Features 

1) Users can search for restaurants using geolocation
2) Users can search for restaurants using City/State
3) Users can see a list of restaurants based on their search
4) Users can add add their name and party size to the waitlist
5) Users can edit their reservations/waitlist entries
6) Users can delete their reservatiosn/waitlist entries

## Upcoming Features

1) Users will be able to update their geolocation
2) Users will be able to sign in
3) Users can add restaurants to their favorites
4) Users can remove restaurants from their favorites
5) Users can view a list of their favorite restaurants 

### What I learned from this project

1) How React works and how to manipulate renders with states. React will make the application a lot more interactive and versitle. It made making elements (that I would use multiple times) easier to make with the help of Components.
2) Creating and accessing my own database. I wasn't able to find a API that handled restaurant reservations, so I created one. It gave me the introduction on how a database should be structure, how it is accessed, and how clients communicate with it.
