# waitless

A application that will let users find restaurants around their current location (or in a specific city/state) and
let them add their names to the waitlist. The application uses Geolocation, Yelp-Fusion api, and a database/api that I have created myself. 

## Features 

1) Users can search for restaurants using geolocation
2) Users can search for restaurants using City/State
3) Users can see a list of restaurants based on their search
4) Users can add add their name and party size to the waitlist
5) Users can edit their reservations/waitlist entries
6) Users can delete their reservatiosn/waitlist entries

### What I learned from this project

1) How React works and how to manipulate renders with states. React will make the application a lot more interactive and versitle. It made making elements (that I would use multiple times) easier to make with the help of Components.
2) Creating and accessing my own database. I wasn't able to find a API that handled restaurant reservations, so I created one. It gave me the introduction on how a database should be structure, how it is accessed, and how clients communicate with it.
